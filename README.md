# Project-Spotify-ETL-pipeline-Data-Engineering
End-to-end data pipeline using Airflow for automated workflow scheduling, optimizing Spotify's API data loading into PostgreSQL

In this project, I developed an ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline for Spotify API - Get Global Top 50 playlist  https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlist, utilizing Python, Airflow, Docker, and Tableau for comprehensive data management and visualization. With Python, I extracted, transformed, and validated data from Spotify's API, ensuring accuracy and consistency.
To streamline the process, I orchestrated an end-to-end data pipeline using Airflow, seamlessly automating workflow scheduling and optimizing data loading into PostgreSQL. Leveraging Docker, I have containerized the entire pipeline. To enhance data insights, I harnessed Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities, providing intuitive representations of the processed data.

Highlighted Technologies:

Python: Employed for data extraction, transformation, and validation.

Airflow: Orchestrated the automated end-to-end data pipeline.

Docker Desktop: Containerized the pipeline for consistent deployment.

PostgreSQL: Optimized data loading and storage.

Tableau: Utilized for creating impactful data visualizations.

Building upon the foundations laid by (sidharth1805), my project takes a unique approach by incorporating a different API dataset. Leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, I've ventured into data analysis and visualization to uncover meaningful insights. Explore the repository to learn more!
