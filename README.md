# SpotifySync ETL Pipeline - Data Engineering Project

Welcome to the SpotifySync ETL Pipeline project! This end-to-end data pipeline is designed for automated workflow scheduling, optimizing Spotify's API data for the Global Top 50 playlist and loading it into PostgreSQL.

## Project Overview
In this project, I utilized Python, Airflow, Docker, and Tableau to create a robust ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) pipeline. Using the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-playlist), Python extracted, transformed, and validated data, ensuring accuracy and consistency.

## Technologies at Play
- **Python:** Employed for data extraction, transformation, and validation.
- **Airflow:** Orchestrated the automated end-to-end data pipeline.
- **Docker Desktop:** Containerized the pipeline for consistent deployment.
- **PostgreSQL:** Optimized data loading and storage.
- **Tableau:** Utilized for creating impactful data visualizations.

## Project Highlights
To streamline the process, I orchestrated an end-to-end data pipeline using Airflow, automating workflow scheduling and optimizing data loading into PostgreSQL. Leveraging Docker, the entire pipeline is containerized. To enhance data insights, I harnessed Tableau's powerful visualization capabilities, providing intuitive representations of the processed data.

## Project Differentiation
Building upon the foundations laid by [sidharth1805], my project takes a unique approach by incorporating a different API dataset. Leveraging the capabilities of Tableau, I've ventured into data analysis and visualization to uncover meaningful insights.
